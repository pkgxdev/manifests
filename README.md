# `pantry^2`

- Configuration is hardcoded to /etc
- We use prebuilt binaries where possible
  - Notably excepting when the prebuilt binaries vendor libraries we provide
- Windows support from day 1
- Relocatable without environment fixes for all base packages
- If we package a package manager and it provides a tool (in a unpainful way)
  then pkgx will invoke that other tool to get the thing
  - eg. `cargo-binstall`, `npx`, `uvx` etc. will be used instead of us packaging
    them
  - these other mechanisms are generally _preferred_ by the developer and
    end-user, we'll just know how to get you the end-product with a consistent
    CLI
- Minimizing deps on macOS
  - we added deps because Linux needed them in v1 due to laziness and urgency
- No magic
  - git no longer looks for `git-foo` if you type `git foo`
  - etc.
  - we would consider adding these back, but not as _part_ of the package
    itself. The package itself should solely focus on our other goals and
    otherwise be vanilla.
- `pkgx^1,^2` will use pantry^1, `pkgx^3` will use pantry^2
- building with as minimal images as is possible to ensure we are sure about
  what goes into our packages
- All packages designed to install into a shared prefix like `/usr/local`
- No weird handling for calver
- no (or much less) pre-reqs on Linux
  - some deps are unavoidable since they are heavily customized for the system
    eg. librt

## Why TypeScript?

`pantry^1` used YAML & mostly shell script to build and test. YAML just doesnâ€™t
cut it, you end up putting constructs in place to facilitate logic and
complexity mounts and mounts. You may as well just use a real language.

Also we needed a cross platform language to support Windows. Bash is not that.
